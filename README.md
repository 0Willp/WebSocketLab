# üöÄ WebSocket Lab: Exploring Real-Time Communication with Python

## üéØ About the Project
This repository serves as a learning lab for understanding and implementing WebSocket services using Python and the excellent websockets library. The primary goal is to follow the official documentation, build practical examples, and solidify the core concepts of bidirectional, real-time web communication.

Here, we explore everything from a basic echo server to more advanced features like broadcasting messages to multiple connected clients. This project is a hands-on journey into the world of asynchronous, event-driven communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+: The core programming language.

- websockets: A high-performance and easy-to-use library for building WebSocket clients and servers.

- asyncio: Python's standard library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the examples up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0Willp/WebSocketLab 
```

```
cd WebSocketLab

# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Using pip file
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell or pipenv run python websocket.py
```






## üîó Primary Resource
This entire project is guided by the official websockets library documentation, which is a fantastic resource for learning and reference.
